# Medical-Imaging

This project was made as a part of my postgraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering

Context: An interesting project on CT (Computed Tomography) image reconstruction and
processing.

In this project are studied the following:

a) the effect of angular sampling (number of projections),

b) the effect of projection sampling,

c) the effect of the reconstruction filter,

d) the effect reconstruction filter cut-off frequency.

Assignments:

• Reading/presentation of two-dimensional cross-sectional image data using a volume normalization function [0,1],

• Extracting sinograms (with fanbeam transformation) for specific values of projections sampling Δr (Sensor Spacing) and angular sampling Δθ (Rotation Increment),

• Use of different projection modification filters (reconstruction filters: Hanning, Hamming, Ram-Lak and Cosine),

• Use of different filter cut-off frequencies with use of the max frequency (frequency scaling % of maximum frequency),

• Use of ifanbeam function for image reconstruction,

• Conclusions and discussion on the results.

Software: Matlab, Octave, Sublime, Libre Office, LibreOffice Calc (Excel)

Methods: Fanbean, iFanbean, CNR, SNR, ESF, LSF, Reconstruction filters

O.S.: Linux-ubuntu


==================

How to run:

Open MATLAB or Octave and place all files in the same folder. Then run "main.m" file and follow instructions on command line.
